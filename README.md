# urban-infrastructure-load-analysis
## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes electricity and water consumption across urban buildings to uncover inefficiencies, peak loads, and sustainability opportunities. Using **Python** and **MySQL**, it demonstrates how data analytics can support smarter infrastructure planning and resource optimization.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **MySQL**: Data storage and querying
- **Streamlit** *(optional)*: Interactive dashboard
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Exploratory analysis

## 📁 Dataset Description

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `buildings.csv` | Building metadata: zone, type, occupancy |
| `electricity_usage.csv` | Daily electricity usage per building |
| `water_usage.csv` | Daily water usage per building |
| `zone_info.csv` | Zone-level temperature and population density |

---

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Zone-wise electricity and water consumption
- Normalized usage per occupant to detect inefficiencies
- Daily usage trends for selected buildings
- Heatmap-ready data for zone intensity visualization
